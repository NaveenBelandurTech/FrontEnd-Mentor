# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## 👋 Welcome!

Thanks for checking out my solution to the **Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component** challenge.

This is a simple and clean **static page** built using **HTML and CSS**, based on the design provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).  
It helped me practice layout, spacing, alignment, and responsiveness in a minimal design.

## 🧠 About The Project

The challenge was to build a **QR code card component** that looks as close as possible to the given design.  

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements (if any)

This project demonstrates:
- Centering elements both vertically and horizontally
- Using semantic HTML structure
- Applying consistent padding, margins, and typography
